# Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence tool that helps software developers write code. It is an extension for the Visual Studio Code editor, a free and widely used code editor. It is also available as a plugin for the Neovim and JetBrains code editors.

GitHub Copilot requires a $10/month subscription. If you're a student with a .edu email address, you can get it for free. You might wonder whether $10/month is worth it. After using it with this book, you'll see for yourself why GitHub Copilot is worth the cost.

I'll show how to set up VS Code and Copilot but first I'll explain why coding with Copilot is so important.

## Why Copilot
Simply put, Copilot is the future of coding.

Copilot was introduced in mid-2021 and launched as a paid service in mid-2022. Before Copilot was introduced, professional software programmers did three things:
- conceptualize the programming of product requirements as abstract thoughts or pseudocode
- write code, drawing on years of experience to get syntax and structure correct for every feature
- review and refine code to optimize performance or improve code quality

With Copilot, professional programmers now focus on two things:
- conceptualize product requirements as English-language comments
- review and refine code suggested by Copilot
