# Get Help When You Need It

This chapter appears in the book *Learn Ruby on Rails: First Steps*, but I've included an expanded version here because it is important.

## Example Code

If you follow this tutorial closely, you'll have a working application that closely matches the example app in the [learn-rails](http://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/) GitHub repository. If your application doesn't work after following the tutorial, compare the code to the example app in the GitHub repository, which is known to work.

## Version Check

The code in this tutorial was tested by many people and worked flawlessly at the time this was written. The [learn-rails](http://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/) example application on GitHub serves as a "reference implementation" if you have problems. The example application is updated more frequently than the published tutorial.

You'll find the version number and release date on the first page of this book (under the book title). Check the [learn-rails GitHub repository](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails) to find out if you have the newest version of the book. The README page on the GitHub repo always shows the most recent version number for the book and the tutorial application.

Don't worry if the [learn-rails GitHub repository](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails) seems complicated or difficult to understand. You'll get to know GitHub over time and it will become familiar. For now, it is only important to know that it is there in case you have problems.

Take a moment now to look at the [open issues](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/issues?page=1&state=open) on GitHub to see what problems you may encounter as you work your way through the tutorial. You can look at the [closed issues](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/issues?page=1&state=closed) to see some of the solved problems.

If you have trouble building the application in this book, and suspect something may be out of date, you can [compare the Gemfile in the repo](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/blob/master/Gemfile) to see if we've changed gems or specified version numbers to avoid compatibility issues.

You can also check the [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/blob/master/CHANGELOG.textile) and look at [recent commits](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails/commits/master) to see the current state of the application.

## Getting Help With the Book

Let's consider what to do if you encounter problems as you build the tutorial application in this book.

If you are in a classroom, or studying in a group, ask a peer to look at your problem. Most problems are caused by simple typos or formatting errors. Your classmate may see what you overlooked.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/learn-ruby-on-rails) provides a question-and-answer forum for readers of this book. As the author of this book, I can't solve your individual problems or help you directly by email. If I did, I would not have time to create the tutorials and videos that benefit so many people. However, I watch for questions on Stack Overflow. Everyone benefits when solutions are made public.

- tag your questions on Stack Overflow with **railsapps** for extra attention

If your questions aren't answered on Stack Overflow, try the Reddit forum:

- [/r/rails](https://www.reddit.com/r/rails/)

I sincerely hope you won't encounter obstacles as you build the tutorial application. Thousands of beginners have successfully completed the book and, unless a gem has recently changed, you should have no problem.

Now let's consider where to look for help when you are working on your own Rails projects.

## Getting Help With Rails

### Video Option

Watch the six minute video on YouTube:

- [Get Help with Rails](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvcyW7i5Br4&t=5s)

### Where To Go For Help?

What will you do when you get stuck?

"Google it," of course. But here's a trick to keep in mind. Google has options under "Search tools" to show only recent results from the past year. Use it to filter out stale advice that pertains only to older versions of Rails.

[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ruby-on-rails) is as important as Google for finding answers to programming problems. Stack Overflow answers are often included in Google search results, but you can go directly to Stack Overflow to search for answers to your questions. Like Google, answers from Stack Overflow are helpful if you check carefully to make sure the answers are recent. Also be sure to compare answers to similar questions; the most popular answer is not always the correct answer to your particular problem.

Requests for advice (especially anything that provokes opinions) are often rejected on Stack Overflow. Instead, try Reddit for advice or recommendations. You'll find discussion forums ("subreddits") devoted to [Rails](http://www.reddit.com/r/rails) and [Ruby](http://www.reddit.com/r/ruby/). You can also visit the [Quora](http://www.quora.com/) question-and-answer site for topics devoted to [Rails](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-on-Rails-web-framework) and [Ruby](http://www.quora.com/Ruby-programming-language).

## References

Here are suggestions for the most important references.

If you feel overwhelmed by all the links, remember that you can use this book to build the tutorial application without any additional resources. Right now, it's important to know additional help is available when you need it.

### RailsGuides

The [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) are Rails's official documentation, written for intermediate-level developers who already have experience writing web applications. The Rails Guides are an excellent reference if you want to check the correct syntax for Rails code. You'll be able to use the Rails Guides after completing this tutorial.

### Cheatsheets

Tobias Pfeiffer has created a useful [Rails Beginner Cheat Sheet](http://pragtob.github.io/rails-beginner-cheatsheet/index.html) that provides a good overview of Rails syntax and commands.

Even better than a cheatsheet, for Mac users, is an application named [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) that offers fingertip access to reference documentation for Ruby, Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many other languages and frameworks.

### API Documentation

The API documentation for Ruby and Rails shows every class and method. These are extremely technical documents (the only thing more technical is reading the source code itself). The documents offer very little help for beginners, as each class and method is considered in isolation, but there are times when checking the API documentation is the only way to know for certain how something works.

- official API docs [Rails Documentation](http://api.rubyonrails.org/) 
- Rails API docs with usage notes [apidock.com/rails](http://apidock.com/rails) 
- Ruby API docs with usage notes [apidock.com/ruby](http://apidock.com/ruby)

I recommend [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) as a tool to look up classes, modules, and methods in Ruby and Rails. Dash is a macOS app; use [Zeal](http://zealdocs.org/) on Linux. Dash and Zeal run offline (they don't need an Internet connection) so you can use them anywhere.

## Meetups, Hack Nights, and Workshops

I'd like to urge you to find ways you can work with others who are learning Rails. Peer support is important when you face a challenge and want to overcome obstacles. Sadly, the 2020 (and onwards) pandemic suspended many in-person events but some are back or online.

Most large urban areas used to have meetups or user group meetings for Rails developers. Try [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/) or google "ruby rails (my city)". The community of Rails developers is friendly and eager to help beginners. If you are near a Rails meetup, it is really worthwhile to connect to other developers for help and support. You may find a group that meets weekly for beginners who study together.

Local user groups often sponsor hack nights or [hackathons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) which can be evening or weekend collaborative coding sessions. You don't have to be an expert. Beginners are welcome. You can bring your own project which can be as simple as completing a tutorial. You will likely find a study partner at your level or a mentor to help you learn.

If you are a woman learning Rails, look for one of the free workshops from [RailsBridge](http://railsbridge.org/) or [Rails Girls](http://railsgirls.com/). Rails Girls recently resumed events after the pandemic; RailsBridge may be back by the time you read this. These are not exclusively for women; everyone considered a "minority" in the tech professions is encouraged to participate; and men are included when invited by a woman colleague or friend.

## Pair Programming

Learning to code is challenging, especially if you do it alone. Make it social and you'll learn faster and have more fun.

There's a popular trend in the workplace for programmers to work side-by-side on the same code, sharing a keyboard and screen. It's effective, both to increase productivity and to share knowledge, and many coders love it. When programmers are not in the same office, they share a screen remotely and communicate with video chat.

Look for opportunities to pair program. It's the best way to learn to code, even if your pairing partner is only another beginner. Learn more about pair programming on the site [pairprogramwith.me](http://www.pairprogramwith.me/).

Remote pair programming requires tools for screen sharing and video chat. Pairing sessions often use:

- [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack) extension for VS Code
- [Tuple](https://tuple.app/)
- [Drovio](https://www.drovio.com/)
- [Pop](https://pop.com/)

Remote pair programming is popular so there are many other available tools.

## Pairing With a Mentor

By far, the best way to learn is to have a mentor at your side as you undertake a project. That is an opportunity that is seldom available, unless you've been hired to be part of a team in a company that encourages pair programming.

You can try [RailsMentors](http://www.railsmentors.org/), a network of volunteer mentors offering free help.

If you can pay for help, find a mentor using [HackHands](http://hackhands.com/) or [AirPair](http://www.airpair.com/). Market rates are expensive for a student, obviously, but if you are learning on the job or building an application for your own business, connecting online with a mentor might be a godsend.

[AirPair](http://www.airpair.com/) connects developers for real-time help using video chat and screen sharing. Experts set their own rate and the site matches you according to your budget. Expect to pay market rates for consulting ranging from USD \$40 per hour to \$150 per hour or more.

[HackHands](http://hackhands.com/) promises to instantly connect you with a qualified expert at a cost of one dollar per minute for mentorship using video chat and screen sharing.

## Code Review

Code review is an essential part of the development process. There's always more than one way to implement a feature, and some ways are better than others, but you may not know it unless you ask someone to look at your code. When you pair with a mentor, you get the benefit of code review. But even if you don't have a mentor, you can get code review online. StackExchange, the parent of StackOverflow, has a free site for code review, and a new service promises code review as a service:

- [codereview.stackexchange.com](http://codereview.stackexchange.com/)

Expert code review will accelerate your learning faster than anything else.

Knowing where to go for help is important; it is just as important to stay current.

## Staying Up-to-Date

Rails changes frequently and its community is very active. Changes to Rails, expert blog articles, and new gems can impact your projects, even if you don't work full-time as a Rails developer. Consequently, I urge you to stay up-to-date with news from the community.

I suggest signing up for two weekly email newsletters:

- [Ruby Weekly](http://rubyweekly.com/) - [Green Ruby News](http://greenruby.org/)

Another weekly email newsletter is more technical, and focused on code arriving in the next version of Rails:

- [This Week in Rails](https://rails-weekly.ongoodbits.com/)

For daily news about Rails, check Peter Cooper's [RubyFlow](http://www.rubyflow.com/) site which lists new blog posts from Rails developers each day.

Also take a look at this list of top blogs for Rails developers:

- [45 Ruby Blogs](http://blog.honeypot.io/45-ruby-blogs/)

If you like podcasts, check out [Ruby Rogues](http://rubyrogues.com/) and Envy Labs's [Ruby5](http://ruby5.envylabs.com/).

Finally, you can follow [@rails\_apps](http://twitter.com/rails_apps) on Twitter for news about the RailsApps project.
