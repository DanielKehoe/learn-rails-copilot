# People

This is an archive of Markdown notes. The GitHub repository is a backup of files on my personal computer.

The notes were originally created:
- in the Ulysses application beginning 2020-03-05

I migrated the notes to the Obsidian application and backed them up to GitHub:
- 2022-08-07 (from Ulysses)

## GitIgnore

There's a `.gitignore` file that excludes local files from the GitHub repo. Notably:

### Ulysses
- .Ulysses-*

### Obsidian
- .obsidian/*

### macOS
- .trash/
- .DS_Store

## Notes

I followed the [Curtis McHale](https://curtismchale.ca/) blog post [Sync Your Obsidian Vault for Free with Github](https://curtismchale.ca/2022/05/18/sync-your-obsidian-vault-for-free-with-github/).

I use Denis Olehov's [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) community plugin to automatically commit changes to the repository.
