# Version and Videos

Before you get started, check that this is the most current version of my book.

## Version Check

If you got the book from Amazon, or you found a PDF on the web, check that this version:
- Version 1.0
matches the version number for the online version of the book:
- Learn Ruby on Rails with Copilot

If your version is out of date, use the online edition.

## Get the Videos

You can watch videos as you read the book. The videos are free on YouTube:
- [YouTube Videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/RailsApps)

The videos are a great introduction to Rails. With the book and videos, I promise there is no better way to learn Rails.
