# Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence tool that helps software developers write code. It is an add-on for the Visual Studio Code editor, a free and widely used code editor. It is also available as a plugin for the Neovim and JetBrains code editors.

GitHub Copilot requires a $10/month subscription. If you're a student with a .edu email address, you can get it for free. You might wonder whether $10/month is worth it. After using it with this book, you'll know why GitHub Copilot is worth the cost.

I'll show how to set up VS Code and Copilot but first I'll explain why coding with Copilot is so important.

## Why Copilot
Simply put, Copilot is the future of coding.

Copilot was introduced in mid-2021 and launched as a paid service in mid-2022. Before Copilot was introduced, professional software programmers did three things:
- conceptualize the programming of product requirements as abstract ideas or pseudocode
- write code, drawing on years of experience to get syntax and structure correct for every feature
- review and refine code to optimize performance or improve code quality

With Copilot, professional programmers now focus on two things:
- conceptualize product requirements as English-language comments
- review and refine code suggested by Copilot

In the new AI-assisted world, Copilot does the work of recalling basic logic structure, language usage, and correct syntax for any function you can describe. That's always been the least rewarding and most annoying aspect of programming. For most common problems, Copilot does the work for a programmer, allowing you to focus on creativity and craft.

Programmers now have a different focus. Instead of years of experience with a language, its syntax and usage, developers must skillfully communicate requirements so Copilot can produce relevant code. Copilot gives us code; then we must assess Copilot's suggestions for relevancy, code quality, and performance.

The implications for learners are significant. From earliest days, learning to code meant learning a programming language. Learning a language's syntax and usage took months. Mastery took more than a year. Now Copilot gives you functional, working code in seconds as long as you know how to describe what you want.

Since we no longer have to master a language to express what we need, we can focus on the true skill of a developer: Translating product specifications into maintainable code. The most talented developers are expert at turning a product manager's feature requirements into a useful software application. Developers who are skilled product engineers will become far more important than language experts.

Mastery of software development will still be elusive. Maturity and wisdom will become more important in managing an effective software development process. Software teams will spend more time reviewing and refining code, evaluating Copilot suggestions, making sure code quality is consistent, and developing system architecture that can't be generated by an AI assistant.

As a new programmer, collaboration with senior engineers becomes more important. You'll spend less time slogging through simple problems and instead learn from code reviews how to make code better. You'll still want to seek language mastery but you'll learn from your mentors as you collaboratively review AI-generated code. Ultimately, you'll strive to become the expert that can deliver unique and original feature implementations that lie outside the boundaries of AI knowledge.

This, then, is the future of coding with an AI assistant.

## Limitations of AI
"Artificial intelligence" is a misnomer. Scientists can't really say what constitutes intelligence, much less agree on how it can be artificial. Copilot relies on machine learning models; it's just more fun to call it AI.

Copilot is powered by Codex, a version of OpenAI’s GPT-3, a large language model
