# Learn Ruby on Rails with Copilot

This is an archive of Markdown notes for the book *Learn Ruby on Rails with Copilot*. The book is based on the original [*Learn Ruby on Rails*](https://learn-rails.com/) book.

The notes were originally created as Markdown notes in the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) application beginning 2022-08-16.

## Notes

I followed the [Curtis McHale](https://curtismchale.ca/) blog post [Sync Your Obsidian Vault for Free with Github](https://curtismchale.ca/2022/05/18/sync-your-obsidian-vault-for-free-with-github/).

I use Denis Olehov's [Obsidian Git](https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git) community plugin to automatically commit changes to the repository.
