# AI for Coding

You'll use two AI tools to learn to code, OpenAI ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot. Either of these tools can help a developer write code faster; together, these tools are changing how programmers work.

You likely have encountered ChatGPT, as it is a popular resource for anyone who uses the Internet. In this book, I'll show you how professional programmers use ChatGPT.

GitHub Copilot is a specialized AI tool built just for software developers. It is an add-on for the Visual Studio Code editor, a free and widely used code editor. 

## Programming, Then and Now

In the seven decades since the 1950s, when higher-level programming languages were first introduced, very little has changed in the daily work of a software programmer. Then, as now, we must transform descriptions of a desired software application (in the form of requirements or specifications) into software code that runs on computers.

## Copilot

GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence tool that helps software developers write code. It's been available since mid-2021 as an add-on for the Visual Studio Code editor, a free and widely used code editor. It is also available as a plugin for the Neovim and JetBrains code editors.

GitHub Copilot requires a $10/month subscription. If you're a student with an .edu email address, you can get it for free. Of course, you might wonder whether $10/month is worth it. After using it with this book, you'll see that GitHub Copilot is worth the cost.

First I'll explain why coding with Copilot is so important. Then I'll show how to set up VS Code and Copilot.

## Why Copilot

Simply put, Copilot is the future of coding.

Copilot was introduced in mid-2021 and launched as a paid service in mid-2022. Before Copilot was introduced, professional software programmers did three things:
- conceptualize the programming of product requirements as abstract ideas or pseudocode
- write code, drawing on years of experience to get syntax and structure correct for every feature
- review and refine code to optimize performance or improve code quality

With Copilot, professional programmers now focus on two things:
- conceptualize product requirements as English-language comments
- review and refine code suggested by Copilot

In the new AI-assisted world, Copilot does the work of recalling basic logic structure, language usage, and correct syntax for any function you can describe. That's always been the most arduous aspect of programming. For most common problems, Copilot does the time-consuming work. Programmers can now focus on creativity and craft. Instead of years of experience with a language, its syntax and usage, with Copilot developers will focus on communicating requirements so Copilot can produce relevant code. Copilot gives us code; then we must assess Copilot's suggestions for relevancy, code quality, and performance.

The implications for learners are significant. From earliest days, learning to code meant learning a programming language. Learning a language's syntax and usage took months. Mastery took more than a year. Now Copilot gives you functional, working code in seconds as long as you know how to describe what you want.

Since we no longer have to master a language to express what we need, we can focus on the true skill of a developer: Translating product specifications into maintainable code. The most talented developers are recognized for turning a product manager's feature requirements into a useful software application. Developers who are skilled product engineers will become far more important than language experts.

Mastery of software development will still be elusive. Maturity and wisdom will become more important in managing an effective software development process. Software teams will spend more time reviewing and refining code, evaluating Copilot suggestions, making sure code quality is consistent, and developing system architecture that can't be generated by an AI assistant.

As a new programmer, collaboration with senior engineers also becomes a greater focus of your time at work. You'll spend less time slogging through simple problems and instead learn from code reviews how to make code better. You'll still want to seek language mastery but you'll learn from your mentors as you collaboratively review AI-generated code. Ultimately, you'll strive to become the expert that can deliver unique and original feature implementations that lie outside the boundaries of AI knowledge.

This, then, is the future of coding with an AI assistant.

## What is Copilot
To be clear, "artificial intelligence" is a misnomer. Scientists can't really say what constitutes intelligence, much less agree on how it can be artificial. Copilot is built on machine learning models; it's just more fun to call it AI. 

Copilot is powered by Codex, a version of OpenAI’s GPT-3, a  language model specifically tuned for programming tasks and trained on millions of code repositories (its "corpus"). Copilot finds and reproduces common patterns found in its corpus. As humans, we can only examine and look for common patterns in a handful of code repositories. When we examine a few code samples, we find more differences than similarities. Because Copilot examines millions of code samples, it finds many more similar patterns than we can. It turns out that all existing software consists of common reproducible patterns. Copilot is smarter than us because it sees more code and more patterns faster than we can.

As a beginner or mid-level developer, almost all of the code you  write has been written before by someone else. As a junior developer, you must become familiar with all the familiar patterns used to solve common web development problems. Copilot is the perfect companion to show how other people have solved common problems.

## Limitations of Copilot
As long as you need to write code that someone already wrote, Copilot will give you superpowers. But as soon as you need original code to solve a problem that no one has encountered before, Copilot will fail you.

As a beginning developer, you'll encounter few situations where you are writing code that Copilot has never seen before. When you find you need truly original code, you'll have seen sufficient code suggestions from Copilot that you'll be able to do what humans do best, which is create novel solutions for previously unencountered problems. AI researchers call these "MacGyver problems": challenges that cannot be resolved by pre-existing knowledge or reference to analogous situations. You'll encounter MacGyver problems when you've joined a team that has developed truly unique solutions for uncommon problems. Often that means a proprietary codebase for a unique product. In these situations, software development is truly a collaborative activity among humans and you'll be working with senior developers who can coach you on both the business domain and coding best practices. 

Additionally, though Copilot can give multiple suggestions for any coding challenge, it can't suggest an optimal choice, in terms of performance, maintainability, or code quality. Integration with the rest of your codebase may determine maintainability. And the quality of code drawn from Copilot's corpus many not match the standards or practices of your organization. This is where the collaborative activity of code reviews will guide you to be a better programmer. 

As a beginner, it's important for you to find a first job where senior developers are active and enthusiastic mentors. And if you're coding solo on your side project or startup, you will need a network of peers who can guide you.

In these situations, whether encountering MacGyver problems or reviewing  Copilot's suggestions, you'll begin your transition from beginner to seasoned developer.
