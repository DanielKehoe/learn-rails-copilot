Introduction
============

Welcome. This book is *Learn Ruby on Rails with Copilot*.

It is written for Rails 7.0. Check the [list of Rails releases](https://rubyonrails.org/category/releases) to see if the book is up to date.

In this book, you'll build a working web application so you'll gain
hands-on experience. Along the way, you'll practice techniques used by
professional Rails developers. And I'll help you understand why Rails
is a popular choice for web development.

Read Book One to get the big picture that's missing from other tutorials. Read it anywhere,
on your phone or tablet. It introduces
key concepts so you'll have a solid foundation for continued study. You can start this book before you finish Book One.

This book (Book Two) is for hands-on learning so you'll need your computer to follow this tutorial.

In this book, I also provide links to videos. You can get the videos along with advanced tutorials at
the [tutorials.railsapps.org](https://tutorials.railsapps.org/) site.

Is It for You?
--------------

You don't need to be a programmer to succeed with this book. You'll be surprised how quickly you become familiar with the Unix command line interface and the Ruby programming language even if you've never tried programming before.

Book One provides a primer for the Unix command line, the terminal, and a text editor. If you have no experience with Unix commands, the terminal window, or a text editor, read Book One first. Everything else you need is self-contained in this book.

With this book, my aim is to introduce you to Rails and the techniques of web application development so you can launch a startup or begin a new career.

## What To Expect

There is deep satisfaction in building an application and making it run.
With this book, I'll give you everything you need to build a real-world
Rails application. More importantly, I'll explain everything you build,
so you understand how it works. There will be no mystery code.

When you've completed this tutorial, you will be ready for more advanced
self-study, including the [Capstone Rails Tutorials](https://tutorials.railsapps.org/),
textbook introductions to Rails such as Michael Hartl's [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/),
or workshops and code camps that provide intensive training in Ruby on Rails.

### About Book One

Here's what is covered in Book One, in case you missed it.

In Book One, I explain the culture and practices of the Rails
community. I introduce the basic concepts you'll need to understand
web application development.

Book One will teach you how to be a successful beginner. There is a roadmap, or study guide, in the "Level Up" chapter. It helps to have a map because there is so much to learn. More importantly, to become a skilled Rails developer, you'll need to start writing code, and Book One contains a chapter, "Crossing the Chasm," that will give you a strategy for building your own applications.

### What's in This Book

You'll start coding immediately in this book. It's a hands-on tutorial
that leads you through the code needed to build a real-world web application. Don't
skip around in this book. The tutorial is designed to unfold in
steps, one section leading to another, until you reach the "Testing"
chapter.

You can complete this book in one long weekend, though it will take
concentration and stamina. If you work through the book over a longer
timespan, try to set aside uninterrupted blocks of two hours or more for
reading and coding, as it takes time to focus and concentrate.

### A Warning About Links

My books are densely packed with links for background reading. If you
click every link, you'll be a well-informed student, but you may never
finish the book! It's up to you to master your curiosity. Follow the
links only when you want to dive deeper.

### What Comes Next

The best way to learn is by doing; when it comes to code, that means
building applications. Hands-on learning with actual Rails
applications is the key to absorbing and retaining knowledge.

After you read this book, you'll be able to work with the example applications from the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/). The project provides open source
example applications for Rails developers, for free. Each application is
accompanied by a tutorial in the Capstone Rails Tutorials
series, so there's no mystery code. Each application can be generated in a few minutes
with the [Rails Composer](https://www.railscomposer.com) tool, which professional
developers use to create starter applications.

The open source project is solely supported by subscriptions to the video series and sales of the
[Capstone Rails Tutorials](https://tutorials.railsapps.org/). If you get the videos or the advanced tutorials, you'll have my sincere appreciation for your support.

### Staying In Touch

If you obtained this book from Amazon or a download site, take a moment
to get on the mailing list for the book. I'll let you know when I
release updates to the book.

### A Note to Reviewers and Teachers

This book approaches the subject differently than most introductions to
Rails. In this book, rather than
show the student how to use scaffolding, I introduce the
model-view-controller design pattern by creating the components
manually. Lastly, though every other Rails tutorial shows how to use a
database, this book doesn't, because I want the book to be a short
introduction and I believe the basic principles of a web application
stand out more clearly without adding a database to the application.
Though this tutorial is not a typical Rails introduction, I hope you'll
agree that it does a good job in preparing Rails beginners for continued
study, whether it is a course or more advanced books.

### Using the Book in the Classroom

If you've organized a workshop, course, or code camp, and would like to
assign the book as recommended reading, contact me at
[daniel@danielkehoe.com](mailto:daniel@danielkehoe.com) to arrange
access to the book for your students at no charge.

### Let's Get Started

In the next chapter, we'll learn how to get help when you need it.
