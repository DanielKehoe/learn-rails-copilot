# Version Check, Videos, and More

Before you get started, I want you to have the most current version of my book. Also, I'll tell you how to get the videos and advanced tutorials.

## Version Check

If you have the PDF, ePub, or Mobi versions of the book, check the title page for the version number and look on the webpage for the [learn-rails GitHub repository](https://github.com/RailsApps/learn-rails) to make sure you have the newest version of the book.

I suggest to use the online edition as you build the tutorial application. It is always up to date.

## Get the Videos

You can watch videos as you read the book. A subscription is only $19 per month (there's also a discount when you get the video series plus advanced tutorials). It's easy and you'll learn more:

The videos are a great introduction to Rails. With the videos and the advanced tutorials, I promise there is no better way to learn Rails.
