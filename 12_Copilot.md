# Copilot
GitHub Copilot is an artificial intelligence tool that helps software developers write code. It is an add-on for the Visual Studio Code editor, a free and widely used code editor. It is also available as a plugin for the Neovim and JetBrains code editors.

GitHub Copilot requires a $10/month subscription. If you're a student with a .edu email address, you can get it for free. You might wonder whether $10/month is worth it. After using it with this book, you'll see for yourself why GitHub Copilot is worth the cost.

I'll show how to set up VS Code and Copilot but first I'll explain why coding with Copilot is so important.

## Why Copilot
Simply put, Copilot is the future of coding.

Copilot was introduced in mid-2021 and launched as a paid service in mid-2022. Before Copilot was introduced, professional software programmers did three things:
- conceptualize the programming of product requirements as abstract ideas or pseudocode
- write code, drawing on years of experience to get syntax and structure correct for every feature
- review and refine code to optimize performance or improve code quality

With Copilot, professional programmers now focus on two things:
- conceptualize product requirements as English-language comments
- review and refine code suggested by Copilot

In the new AI-assisted world, Copilot does the work of recalling basic logic structure, language usage, and correct syntax for any function you can describe. That's always been the least rewarding and most time-consuming aspect of programming. For most common problems, Copilot will do that work for you, allowing you to focus on creativity and craft.

Expectations for a programmer's skill will change. Instead of years of experience with a language, its syntax and usage, developers must skillfully communicate requirements so Copilot can produce relevant code. Then developers must assess Copilot's suggestions for relevancy, code quality, and performance.

The implications for learners are significant.
